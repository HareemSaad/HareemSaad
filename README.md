### 🚀 About Me
I'm a blockchain engineer with a strong focus on DeFi protocols and smart contract development.

I enjoy designing systems that are modular, efficient, and scalable — whether it's tokenomics, oracles, or liquidity mechanisms.

Experienced in working across EVM and Solana chains, with a keen interest in cross-chain interoperability.

I bridge the gap between smart contracts and backend infrastructure, ensuring everything works seamlessly from chain to client.

Passionate about decentralization, clean code, and shipping features that actually matter.
